# go--
It's Go, but *everything* is exported (like Python).

This was a fun experimental fork of [Go](https://golang.org/), which I found to be extremely productive and user-friendly.  I finally decided to discontinue the experiment because `go vet` no longer worked and I didn't want to spend the time to fix it.  Also, I found an alternative workaround to solve the original problem that let me to create this fork in the first place.
